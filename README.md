# Featurer
Easy _feature flag_ for your project.

By default `featurer` saves all the data in Redis, although you can create your own adapter.

## Features

* Shipped with Redis support by default
  * Fast
  * Doesn't overload your main database
  * Doesn't save data in your application's memory(don't lose it when restarting)
  * Redis goodies :D
* Non-framework dependent
  * Plug it wherever you want, Sinatra, Padrino, Rails, your own scripts...
* Create your own adapter

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'featurer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install featurer

## Usage

### Configure your connection:
```ruby
Featurer.configure(host: host, port: port)
```

or use the default _localhost_ connection:

```ruby
Featurer.init
```

### Start using it:

#### Per user feature

For different users:

```ruby
Featurer.register(:feature, [first_user_id, sercond_users_id, third_user_id])
```

or single:

```ruby
Featurer.register(:feature, user_id)
```

Then request the enabled feature:

```ruby
Featurer.on?(:feature, user_id)
```

#### Global feature

```ruby
Featurer.register(:feature, true)
```

Then request the enabled feature:

```ruby
Featurer.on? :feature
```

#### Deleting features

```ruby
Featurer.delete(:feature)
```

#### Create your own adapter

Just extend `Featurer::Adapter`, add the basic methods and your are done! e.g

```ruby
class TestAdapter < Featurer::Adapter
  def prepare
    # if defined this is called automatically
    # in order to initialize your adapter
    # e.g: @redis = Redis.new
  end

  def register(name, value = true)
    # your logic
  end

  def on?(name, value = true)
    # your logic
  end

  def delete(name)
    # your logic
end
```

**This will automatically register your adapter in the adapters list**.
Also it will give it an _id_, in this case `test`, is the lowercase _class name_ without
the adapter keyword.

Then initialize your `featurer`:

```ruby
Featurer.configure(adapter: :test, custom: :option)
```

Your are ready to go! No need to call `.init`
